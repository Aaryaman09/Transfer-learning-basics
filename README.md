# Transfer-learning-basics
This is the demonstration of transfer learning with MNIST digits dataset. I created a base model with MNIST dataset using keras and later chopped off output layer of 10 nodes (digit Classifier) and replaced it with a binary classifier 2 nodes layer with softmax for classification of odd and even.
